PROJECT

The purpose of this project is to conduct an online survey and ask user to enter their names, ages, and genders.
HOWEVER, to gather that information from user, we should first ask if they are willing to participate in the survey or not. If a user does not want to participate in the survey, then we SHOULD NOT ask any question to that user. 


BEFORE WRITING THE ACTUAL PROGRAM

There are 2 classes that needs to be done to store data properly


QUESTIONS TO ASK IN PROGRAM

Would you like to join our survey? (Y/N)

If user enters Y, then ask below questions and store data but if user enters N, then do not ask those questions and go for another user.

What is your name?

How old are you?

What is your gender? (F/M) 

NOTE: This program will end once you got 3 users to join to your survey. So, basically you will be gathering information from 3 users only.
 

EXPECTED OUTPUT 

Print information for each participant

Print how many participants were male

Print how many participants were female

Print the age of youngest person

Print the age of eldest person
